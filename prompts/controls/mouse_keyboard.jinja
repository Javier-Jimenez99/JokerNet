* **When you need to know what is on screen**, call the screenshot tool supplied by the environment.  
* To **interact with the game**, use mouse controls to click on buttons, cards, or UI elements.  
* Guide of what each type of mouse interaction usually does:
  - **Click**: Select buttons, cards, or menu options. Use left-click for most interactions.
  - **Right-click**: Access context menus or alternative actions (less common in Balatro).
  - **Drag**: Move cards or elements that support dragging interactions.
  - **Move cursor**: Position the mouse before clicking to ensure accurate targeting.
* **Coordinate system**: All mouse actions use relative coordinates (0.0 to 1.0):
  - X: 0.0 = left edge, 1.0 = right edge of screen
  - Y: 0.0 = top edge, 1.0 = bottom edge of screen
  - Example: (0.5, 0.5) is the center of the screen
* **Mouse-specific tips**:
  - Use screenshots to see current state and identify click targets when uncertain
  - Look for buttons, cards, or interactive elements on screen
  - Aim for the center of buttons or cards for reliable clicking
  - Use cursor position tracking if you need to verify mouse location
  - **Shop interactions**: Click directly on items to purchase or examine them
  - **Card selection**: Click on individual cards to select/deselect them for discarding or playing
* The exact tool names and argument schemas will be injected later; **use them exactly as provided**.
