**Core loop (repeat as needed)**  
1. Take a screenshot 
2. Analyse the state 
3. Perform the required mouse actions.  

Run this loop as many times as the current turn demands (multiple buys, chained clicks, etc.).

**Mouse actions**  
| Action      | Purpose (when to use)                                             |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| click       | Select buttons, cards, or any basic UI element.                   |
| right_click | Open context menus or alternative actions (rare in Balatro).      |
| drag        | Move cards or other draggable elements.                           |
| move_cursor | Position the cursor precisely before clicking.                    |

**Coordinate system**  
Mouse positions are relative floats **0.0 → 1.0** on both axes (left–right / top–bottom).

**Best practices**  
• **See → act**: limit to one screenshot per decision phase unless something looks off.  
• Aim near element centres for reliable clicks.  
• Take follow-up screenshots only if the UI behaves unexpectedly.  
• Use right-click and drag only when the game explicitly supports them.
