Core loop (repeat as needed)
• Take a screenshot → analyse what's on screen → perform the next mouse action.
• After an action, wait briefly; if the action didn't work retry adapting parameters.

Mouse actions
• Click: select buttons, cards, tiles, or other UI elements.
• Drag: move draggable elements when the game clearly expects it.
• Move cursor: position precisely, then click for small or tricky targets.

Coordinate system
• Positions are in PIXEL coordinates (integer values).
• Screen dimensions are provided by tools - use these to understand the screen size.
• Always derive targets from the latest screenshot, don't guess or hard-code coordinates.
• Use exact pixel coordinates based on what you see in screenshots.

Targeting & accuracy
• Aim near the visual centre of the element; ensure the cursor tip lands inside it.
• If a click fails, adjust slightly and retry after re-checking with a screenshot.
• Use the screen resolution information provided by tools for accurate targeting.

Best practices
• One screenshot per decision phase is usually enough; take extras only if something looks off or after major actions.
• Every action should advance the objective (e.g., beat the blind, confirm a purchase, progress dialogue).
• All coordinates must be in pixels - use exact integer coordinates based on screenshot analysis.
