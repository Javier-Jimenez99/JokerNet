* **When you need to know what is on screen**, call the screenshot tool supplied by the environment.  
* To **interact with the game**, call the input tool with one or more controller tokens (e.g. `X`, `Y`, `B`, `RB`, `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`).  
* Guide of what each button usually does. This does not mean that the game will always behave this way, but it is a good starting point:
  - `A`: Press buttons, confirm, or pick a card.
  - `B`: Go back, cancel, or exit a menu.
  - `X`: Play hand.
  - `Y`: Discard cards.
  - `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`: Navigate menus or select cards.
* **Gamepad-specific tips**:
  - **Starting screen looks empty?** If "Select" button is not highlighted, send a single LEFT or RIGHT input to reveal the first selectable element.
  - **Lost in a multi-page menu?** Send a BACK/CANCEL input once to retreat one level, then request a screenshot if needed.
  - **Shop feels frozen after a purchase?** Move the cursor UP or DOWN once to refresh focus.
* The exact tool names and argument schemas will be injected later; **use them exactly as provided**.
