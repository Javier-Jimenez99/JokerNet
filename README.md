## 🤖 Multiagent System with LangGraph

At the heart of JokerNet lies a sophisticated multiagent system built using LangGraph, a powerful framework for orchestrating complex AI workflows. This system intelligently decomposes the challenging task of autonomous Balatro gameplay into coordinated, specialized agents that collaborate seamlessly.

### 🎭 Agent Roles and Coordination

The multiagent architecture features three specialized agents, each with distinct responsibilities:

<div align="center">

| **Agent** | **Role** | **Specialization** | **Key Functions** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 🧠 **Planner Agent** | Strategic Director | High-level decision making | Task decomposition, strategic planning |
| 👁️ **Visualizer Agent** | Vision Specialist | Computer vision analysis | Screenshot processing, game state extraction |
| ⚙️ **Worker Agent** | Execution Expert | Action implementation | Gamepad control (primary), mouse interaction (under development) |

</div>

### 🔄 LangGraph Workflow Structure

The system leverages LangGraph's state graph approach to manage complex agent interactions and decision flows:

```python
# Core state management from the implementation
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    input: list[BaseMessage]
    game_states: list[str]
    worker_responses: list[str]
    last_screenshot: str
    worker_step: int
    planner_step: int
    subtasks: list[PlannerResponse]
    output: AIMessage
```

### 📊 Visual Workflow Diagram

```mermaid
---
config:
  flowchart:
    curve: linear
---
graph TD;
	__start__([<p>__start__</p>]):::first
	planner_visualizer(planner_visualizer)
	planner(planner)
	worker_visualizer(worker_visualizer)
	worker(worker)
	tool(tool)
	output(output)
	__end__([<p>__end__</p>]):::last
	__start__ --> planner_visualizer;
	planner -. &nbsp;end&nbsp; .-> output;

	output --> __end__;
	classDef default fill:#f2f0ff,line-height:1.2
	classDef first fill-opacity:0
	classDef last fill:#bfb6fc
```

**🔍 Workflow Breakdown:**

1. **🚀 START Node**: Initial user input processing and system initialization
2. **🧠 Planner-Visualizer Node**: Strategic analysis with visual context capture
3. **📋 Planner Node**: High-level task decomposition and strategic planning
4. **🔀 Conditional Routing**: Intelligent decision branching based on planner actions
5. **👁️ Worker-Visualizer Node**: Context-aware screenshot capture for execution
6. **⚙️ Worker Node**: Precise action planning and tool orchestration
7. **🎮 Tool Node**: Direct game control execution (gamepad actions - mouse under development)
8. **🔄 Conditional Worker Routing**: Adaptive loop control with success/failure handling
9. **📤 Output Node**: Final result formatting and user response delivery

**🛡️ Advanced Flow Control Features:**
- **⏱️ Max Step Limits**: Prevents infinite loops (5 planner steps, 3 worker steps)
- **💾 State Persistence**: Maintains conversation history and game state across iterations
- **🛟 Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and intelligent completion detection
- **🔧 Tool Integration**: **Exclusive MCP server integration** for game control (no direct API usage)

*This architecture enables complex decision-making while ensuring system reliability and user control. For the web interface that interacts with these agents, see [Streamlit Interface](#-streamlit-web-interface)*

## ⚠️ **Important Notice: Mouse Controller Status**

### **Mouse Control - Under Development**

**⚠️ WARNING: The mouse controller is currently under development and does not work yet.**

While the system supports both gamepad and mouse control modes, the mouse control functionality is not operational at this time. The gamepad controller works reliably, but mouse-based interaction requires additional development.

### **Technical Challenges & Attempts**

I attempted to implement mouse control using advanced AI techniques:

#### **Grounding AI Approach**
- **Model Used**: HuggingFace `ASKUI/PTA-1` (Pointing and Text Recognition AI)
- **Purpose**: Grounding AI for object detection and UI element recognition
- **Expected Outcome**: Automatic detection of cards, buttons, and interactive elements in Balatro

#### **Implementation Challenges**
- **Card Detection Failure**: The `ASKUI/PTA-1` model was unable to reliably detect Balatro's playing cards
- **UI Element Recognition**: Difficulty in identifying buttons, text, and interactive components
- **Game State Analysis**: Inconsistent results when trying to locate game elements programmatically

#### **Root Causes**
- **Visual Complexity**: Balatro's artistic card designs and dynamic animations made detection challenging
- **Resolution Variability**: Different screen resolutions affected detection accuracy
- **Real-time Updates**: Game state changes faster than AI processing could keep up
- **Model Limitations**: The grounding AI model wasn't trained on gaming-specific visual patterns

### **Current Workaround**
- **Use Gamepad Control**: The primary control method that works reliably
- **Manual Mouse Control**: Direct mouse interaction through the noVNC interface
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combining gamepad automation with manual mouse interventions

### **Future Development Plans**
- **Custom Vision Models**: Training specialized models for Balatro-specific object detection
- **Computer Vision Pipeline**: Implementing robust image processing and feature extraction
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Using RL agents trained specifically for mouse control
- **Alternative AI Models**: Exploring other grounding AI models optimized for gaming

**For now, please use the gamepad controller for automated gameplay. Mouse control will be available in future updates.**

            if config.deck and G.P_CENTERS[config.deck] then
                G.GAME.viewed_back = G.P_CENTERS[config.deck]
            end

            -- Programmatic game start
            if G.FUNCS and G.FUNCS.start_run then
                G.FUNCS.start_run(nil, {
                    stake = config.stake or 1,
                    seed = (config.seed and config.seed ~= "random") and config.seed or nil
                })
            end
